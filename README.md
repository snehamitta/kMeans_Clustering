# Spectral Clustering

Elbow and Silhouette graphs give the optimal number of clusters to work with. The dataset this was performed on was the cars.csv file. 

Spectral clustering was done on the spiral.csv file. A few observations didn't fit into the right cluster when kMeans was directly applied. When spectral clustering was applied, the misclassified observations fit into the right cluster.
